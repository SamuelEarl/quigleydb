# How to Connect to a Database Server

Let's say that I have written a simple database in Mojo on my computer. Now I want to connect to it from another Mojo application via HTTP on localhost. How do I turn my database into a database server and then connect to it?

The answer to this question is in the ChatGPT chat titled "Connect Mojo DB via HTTP". I should record those notes here.
